# üñ•Ô∏è MIPS Assembly Final Project

This repository contains my **MIPS Assembly final project** - a short platformer game coded entirely in MIPS Assembly! 

Players navigate three rooms, avoiding slime enemies and obstacles, while collecting pickups that grant new abilities. Core gameplay mechanics, collision detection, and input handling are implemented directly at the assembly level using low-level memory management, branching, and register operations.

**Video Demo:**  
You can watch a full walkthrough and demo of the project on my YouTube channel:
