# üñ•Ô∏è MIPS Assembly Final Project

This repository contains my **MIPS Assembly final project**.  
The project demonstrates my understanding of low-level programming concepts, MIPS assembly language and a little bit of game design :).

**Video Demo:**  
You can watch a full walkthrough and demo of the project on my YouTube channel:
